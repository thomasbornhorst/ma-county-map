## Overview

This website displays the different counties of Massachusetts and allows for each to be clicked on and inspected for more detail.

## Reason for creation

I started this project as a potential website to help out a company where I knew someone. That didn't end up happening and so I transitioned it into a fun project for myself to do in order to learn more about web development and also gives me a chance to explore more information about the areas of my home state, Massachusetts.
